##RSpec Lecture
I gave a lecture to the October 2014 Cohort [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) in early November. It was meant
to teach them about usefulness, proper use, and potential misuse of [RSpec mocks/doubles](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks).
Tests and classes based on and heavily borrowed from [Hadi](http://www.github.com/schlap)'s [Pub Fight](https://github.com/Schlap/pub-fight) program.
